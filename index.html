    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p> I am Abhishek Shrivastava, a B.Sc. Computer Science graduate with over 6 years of hands-on experience in New Product Development (NPD), 
      quality documentation, and machine shop operations within the automotive and manufacturing industry. 
      I have worked extensively in IATF-driven environments, supporting end-to-end product development from documentation to production readiness.
      My professional journey spans roles such as Assistant Manager – NPD, Junior Engineer – NPD, and Document Controller, 
      where I have consistently contributed to APQP & PPAP execution, audit support, process documentation, and cross-functional coordination. 
      I am experienced in handling customer requirements, managing technical documents, and ensuring compliance with quality standards.
      I am known for my detail-oriented approach, strong documentation skills, and ability to work collaboratively with production, quality, 
      design, and customer teams. I aim to continuously improve processes, support smooth product launches, 
      and add value to manufacturing operations through structured quality systems and data-driven analysis.</p>
